## 🚀 Features

- 🧱 Draw walls by clicking and dragging
- 🟩 Visualize pathfinding from start (green) to end (red)
- 🔍 Supports multiple algorithms:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - A* (A-Star)
- 🧩 Maze Generation:
  - Random Maze
  - Recursive Division Maze
- 🎞️ Adjustable animation speed
- 🔁 Reset & regenerate instantly
- 🖱️ Fully interactive grid (mouse-based)
